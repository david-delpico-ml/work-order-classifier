## Project Overview
### Goal
To predict technician work category using NLP, improving repairing/maintenace response time, eliminating workload and avoiding non-job-related learning.
### Problem Statement
The workers in the hospital send a reparing/maintenace request throw a ticketing software. They have to specify the category of the maintenance technician to whom is intended (electrician, mechanic, plumber, carpenter, etc.) but often the incidences are miscategoriced because the healthcare personel hasn't been trainned for it. This situation leads to a slower response of the maintenace team and extra workload (and frustration) to the healthcare personel that has to learn constantly who is in charge of every part of the equipment and building instead of performing their duties. The situation is compounded when new short term employees arrive.
### Metrics
Cause the number of incidences is different for every categorie (imbalanced classes), I opt for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score with Macro Average, so all the categories are treated equally. I use confusion matrix for exploring.

### Approach
Supervised learning using a clasification model

## Data Collection

## Data Exploration (EDA)

## Data Preprocessing

## Feature Engineering

## Model Selection

## Model Training

## Model Evaluation

## Model Deployment

## Conclusion & Future Work
Use pretrainned weights to compare.
Can be use in case an urgency and someone want to know who has to call just saying what's the problem. Use the incidence placement for better accuracy.
